# Data-Structures
To run the library:
	All that is required to run is to open up the test file and run them all, 
  if you are using an editor like VScode, a tests tab will appear on the left, 
  it should look like the figure below. All Tests can be run with one button, 
  do note however that there are roughly 100 tests, so it could take a second.
 
  This library relies on its folder structure, if any of the files are moved out of their folder, 
  it will cause a problem for the compiler due to the packaging, 
  therefore please keep everything the way it is in the repo.
